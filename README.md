# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

This is the readme file for the pet adoption validator

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create a function that would check and validate the pet adoption details based on certain parameters given.

## Design Choices and Functionality

In order to achive the required validation and invalidation outputs, I created a function validateSyntax which used regular expression to account for all Alphaumeric combinations.

This allowed me to be able to create an if statement which basically checked if the input matched the regular expression then it would be valid and if it did not then it would be invalid.

## Technologies Used

\*Javascript for functionality.
